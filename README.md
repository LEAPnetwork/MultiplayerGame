# Prototype no1
* Involves 2 players that need to avoid enemies that spawn from a "tug" that can be pushed with powerups. 
* Each player is controlled by the buttons on each side of the screen (or w&s and upArrow&downArrow on pc, for testing). 
* There are prefabs for players, each type of enemy, each powerup and the life display. The GameMaster handles enemy spawn, some difficulty increase, power up spawn and display of scores and end screen. 
* To some extent there is at least a sentence(comment) in the code that explains what the snippet does. The code is by no means elegant, in fact is really repetitive and simple in concept - repetition the mother of all learning...right?

* there's and apk in there too - works fine :). The speed of the players may be a little fast/difficult for phones, didn't test on a tablet yet.

* Needs better graphics for players/enemies/powerups.
